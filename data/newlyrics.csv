It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger. Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker. By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely. Once I was eleven years old. I always had that dream like my daddy before me So I started writing songs, I started writing stories Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me Cause only those I really love will ever really know me Once I was twenty years old, my story got told Before the morning sun, when life was lonely. Once I was twenty years old. I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure. Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major. I got my boys with me atleast those in favor And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later. Once I was 20 years old, my story got told I was writing about everything, I saw before me Once I was 20 years old. Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming. Soon we'll be 30 years old. I'm still learning about life My woman brought children for me So I can sing them all my songs And I can tell them stories most of my boys are with me Some are still out seeking glory And some I had to leave behind My brother I'm still sorry Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61 Remember life and then your life becomes a better one I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold Or will I have a lot of children who can bore me Soon I'll be 60 years old Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold Or will I have a lot of children who can bore me Soon I'll be 60 years old Once I was seven years old, my mama told me Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely Once I was seven years old Once I was seven years old"
